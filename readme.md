### Game of Life

Note for seed JSONs, we are using column major, so the seeds are displayed rotated

Run via command line, 1st arg is the filename in seed folder, 2nd arg is delay between generations:

e.g. `node app.js flower.json 250`

Can also run without args, it will prompt for the file name and the delay in ms on 1 line, with a space separating them

##### This will run continuously until - Ctrl + C or force exit
